# End User Guide - Partner Admin & Policy Manager

## What all activities does a \'Partner Admin\' perform?

Partner Admin [supervises]{.mark} the overall partner and policy
management functionalities in PMS. The admin is responsible for:

-   Upload Root Certificate

-   Intermediate CA Certificates

-   Manage Partners and Policies

-   Approve / Reject new entries created by different partners or
    deactivate partner related records

Note:

Partner Admin can also assume the role of Policy Manager to

-   Create and manage policy groups and policies

## What all activities does a 'Policy Manager' perform? 

As a partner admin [cum]{.mark} policy manager a Policy Manager performs
following roles:

1.  Creation and management of Policy Group, Authentication Policy,
    Datashare Policy

**Notes**:

In UI - both PARTNER_ADMIN and POLICYMANAGER roles should be granted for
the '**POLICIES**' card to appear in the dashboard.

## Partner Admin / Policy Manager 

# Register as Partner Admin and Policy Manager

Partner admin too has to register [himself]{.mark} just like any other
'Partner Registration' by selecting any one of the partner type i.e.
Admin has to register in PMS with any one of the partner type.

## Registering as Partner Admin

Partner Admin can register in PMP as any one of the partner type and
then get the various roles/privileges by going to Keycloak.

![](./media/media/image1.png)

## Using Keycloak to allocate 'Partner Admin' and/or 'Policy Manager'

After registration .....you need to come to keycloak..

1.  Go to keycloak and search your user name in Users tab.

![](./media/media/image2.png)

2.  Go to the **Role Mapping** tab.

![](./media/media/image3.png)

3.  In the **Available Roles** section, select **PARTNER_ADMIN** or
    **POLICYMANAGER**, click **Add** to move the selected role to the
    **Assigned Roles** list.

![](./media/media/image4.png)

4.  You can now log in to the **PMS** portal with the same user
    credentials and you will have access to the **Admin Dashboard**.

![](./media/media/image5.png)

**Note:** Add POLICYMANAGER role if Policies card should be made
accessible in UI

## [Allocating Policy Manager Role]{.mark}

By following the above steps (1-4) in keycloak, the admin can also
configure POLICY_MANAGER role to view and manage **Policies** card as
shown in the dashboard below:

![](./media/media/image6.png)

**Notes:**

**1.** If only 'Policy Manager' role is configured in keycloak, then the
user will still be able to access as a normal partner. Hence 'Partner
Admin' & 'Policy Manager' roles are necessary to access all the cards
above.

2. After configuring the roles and if PMS portal is still logged in,
make sure to logout and login again for the roles to get updated.
